# Overview


This program is a version of the game called Space Invaders that was an arcade machine game that was first around in the late 70's. In the game you are a spaceship that is defending its base from waves of aliens. Your spaceship can move and fire lasers at the enemies that will disappear when they are hit. My design is very similar except for the fact that when an enemy is destroyed, they start at the top of the screen again. I really enjoy making games and wanted a language that would allow me to have a lot of freedom with the design. PyGame was able to work with all the parts of the program that I wanted to implement. I had a lot of fun writing this program and would definitely like to build more projects with it in the future.
